            </div>
            <p>As a guy without a good job -I had one, but it was never my idea to keep that job forever-, I started looking for new paths that I could take in my life. I started looking on the www and found multiple options, all in coding. I was too late to go to the Becode in Antwerp so I chose to come here instead of waiting half a year. After I got selected I had to come here every wednesday and friday and work the other days from home. The good thing about comming to Brussels is that I do not only work on my coding skills, but learn French as well. Something with two birds and a stone or stuff. Now I hope that I can do very well on the excercises and will become a master coder. Ganbaru!!</p>
